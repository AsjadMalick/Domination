HOW TO PLAY
******************************************************

Note, if both players enter the same name, or both players leave the entry
blank, the names will default to Stratus and Cirrus

***OBJECTIVES***
The game ends when the enemy's Capital is dominated or both players reach their
50th turn. In the latter case, the winner is decided by taking the product of 
the total amount of land and multiplying it by the the total number of 
resources. The nation with the largets product wins.

***MECHANICS***
Each nation/Structure has 4 resources available:

- Coins (represented by the stack of coins)
- Attack (represented by the red Sword)
- Defense (represented by the blue shield)
- Technology (represented by the green flask)


A nation gains resorces every turn. They are used to buy structures that help 
the nation in dominating the other.

The more resources a structure has invested in it, the harder it is to dominate.

You are allowed to make as many moves as you want before you hit end turn.

***Structures***

Land (P):
- The most Basic structure
- Costs coins to buy, can be converted to other structures except Capital.

Captial (C):
- The essential sturcture, loss of this means loss of the game.
- No initial cost, and can only have defense invested into it.

Market (M):
- Economic power House, costs coins and defense intiially.
- For each turn a nation has a market, the nations total coins and technoloy
  increase. If there are multiple markets that have remained in one nations
  control for longer, the effect will increase.

Lab (L):
- Facility of research and innovation, costs coins, defense and technology.
- For each turn a nation has a lab, the nation's total attack and defense will 
  increase. Any structures other than land will have their structural defense
  increase by the same percentage. if there are multiple Labs that have 
  remained in one nations control for longer, the effect will increase.

Fort (F):
- Mode of attacking, costs coins, attack, defense and technology.
- In order to play offensively there must be at least one fort belonging to the 
  attacking nation. The forts attack, coins and technology are used to determine
  its strength.
- If there are multiple forts, the closest one to the target will be used.

***OFFENSIVE PLAY***
- The attacking fort's attack, tech and coins are used to calculate its strength
  and the defending structure's resources are used to determine its resistance.
- The calculation yields a % chance to invade, a number higher than 100, means
  it is certain that the structure will be dominated, and a negative value 
  means it is impossible to dominate.
- If you are able to dominate, the structure becomes yours, and any resources
  invested into the structure stay there.
- If the domination fails, the attacking fort loses all its resources, becomes a
  plot of land, and half the forts resources go to the defending nation. Also 
  the attacking nation's move ends. 

 Now that you know how things work, can you Dominate your Enemy?
